_A very simple interpreted programming language for beginners._

## Code in Action

```
# import the math module
fetch std_math;

obj x = 0;

# let's go for a walk!
walk i = 0 through 10 {
    obj x = x + 1;

    if x == 5 {
        leave;
    }
}

# print the value of 'x'
serve(x);

# greet someone
func greet(name) {
    serve("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("my Maid");

serve("Pi is equal to: " + tostring(math_pi));
serve("We have reached the end of our program. I hope you enjoyed!");
```

```
# import the math module
fetch std_math; # imports
serve(math_pi); # built in functions
obj x = 0; # object creation

# looping
walk i = 0 through 10 {
    serve("'i' is equal to: " + tostring(i));

    if i == 5 {
        leave;
    }
}

while 1 == 1 {
    serve("Inside a while loop");

    leave;
}

# function definitions
func greet(name) {
    serve("Hello my " + name + "!");

    give null;
}

greet("Maid");

```

## Package Installation

You can install **Maid** Programming Language globally using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) which comes pre-packaged when downloading Rust:

```bash
cargo install maid-lang

```
Once installed, run the maid command:
```
maid new project
cd project
maid home.maid
```
Watch your output:

```
'Hello, my Maid!'
```

Now get busy creating in Maid! You may also check out the quick setup instructions in the [Guide Book](https://maidcode.me/docs/getting-started/installation) which I may extend upon.
